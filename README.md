## General Information
This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 
- If one is able to identify the risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.

    - Borrowers with higher income is taking loan mostly for home improvements,than for small businesses and then credit cards

- Features having no or least impact

    - Home ownership seems not to be good driving factor for deciding loan approval
